# Contact Form Demo

I built this just to play around with vite, tailwindcss, zod, react-hook-forms, etc.  I like this toolkit quite a bit!

## Configure the environment

You can actually send emails if you want to.  Sign up for [emailjs](emailjs.com) and create a template with the id `contact_form`.

Alternatively, just use [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com/) to see what the requests would look like.

Duplicate the `.env` file as `.env.local` and fill in the config items you want to use.

## Running the application

The first time you clone it you need to run `yarn` to install the dependencies.

Then, `yarn dev` to start the dev server.
